## I AM A TRUE CRYPTO ENTHUSIAST!

Work full day and night! Like helping projects and the crypto community!

I take part in projects that radically change the direction of cryptography.

Like to be a part of historical changes in ecosystems, to leave my mark.

I help projects develop, help the community and go side by side in the development of a new era of evolution.

I have video and audio editing skills. I work in the following programs: Adobe AE, Vegas Pro, Reaper, Cubase.

3D modeling in Cinema 4D, Blender, Element 3D.

I have also upgraded my level to higher quality in both graphic and audio formats.

I have mastered the technique of creating NFT maps!

I like the team spirit. I'm part of the team.

We translate videos from English to Russian (translation and editing, voice acting, voice processing, images).

For the Russian-speaking community. To increase audience, engagement and accessibility.

Thus, we help three parties to be useful (for personal growth, for the project and for the community)!
